     <u> LaVera Sundstrom </u>  <br/><br/>
<img alt='laVeraSundstrom.jpg'  src='http://bill.sundstrom.us/archives/laVeraSundstrom.jpg'  /><br/> </p>
<p>
Mrs. LaVera Sundstrom, 76, of Ocean Springs,, passed away on the morning of Monday, 2 October 2006, after a brave battle against gall bladder cancer. She was diagnosed in late June, 2006. <br/>
LaVera was born 19 January 1930 in Brownsdale Township, Minnesota. She lived in southeastern Minnesota until she met and married her husband, Sidney in 1951. During their marriage they enjoyed travel to the Far East and Europe. They lived in various states and settled in Ocean Springs in 1969. <br/>
She was the bridal consultant in the china and gifts department for Gayfers Department Store (now Dillards) for 18 years. She retired from this job in 1993. <br/>
LaVera was an active member of Christus Victor Lutheran Church, Ocean Springs, since 1972, where she served on the Alter Guild, preparing for the communion services for 18 years. She was an active member of Women of the ELCA and recently had served as Treasurer of her local chapter. She had also worked as the co-coordinator for the congregation's work at the Lord Is My Help. <br/>
LaVera was a volunteer in the Ocean Springs Hospital Auxiliary since 1997, where she worked regularly in the hospital gift shop. She was also an active member in the Day Lily Garden Club, Ocean Springs, and had held several offices in that organization. <br/>
She was preceded in death by her parents, Alma and Emil Dulitz, her sister, Anelda Blanchard and her brother, Norman Dulitz, all of Minnesota. <br/>
Survivors include her husband of 54 years, M. Sidney Sundstrom, her children, Katherine Sundstrom, M.D., of Brooklyn, NY, Steven Sundstrom and his wife, Ellen of Appleton, Wisconsin, Ann Teitel and her husband Alan of Port Washington, NY, and Dawn Sundstrom and her partner Mitzi Griffin of Greenboro, NC, her stepsons, Bill and Brian Sundstrom, both of Minnesota, eight grandchildren (Birgitta Sundstrom, Dain Sundstrom, Aricka Sundstrom, Bjorn Sundstrom, Shelby Sundstrom, Eddy Baggenstoss, Belinda Brody, and Clara Tietel) and three great-grandchildren. <br/>
Visitation will be on Wednesday, October 4, 2006, from 7-9 PM, at the Ocean Springs Chapel of Bradford O'Keefe Funeral Home. The funeral service will be held on Thursday, October 5, 2006, at 10:30 A.M. at Christus Victor Lutheran Church in Ocean Springs. Burial will follow at the Biloxi National Cemetery.  <br/>
In lieu of flowers the family requests memorials be sent to Christus Victor Lutheran Church in Ocean Springs or to the American Cancer Society.
</p>

Before I say anything else, I must report the passing of my father's wife of 55 years.  LaVera Dulitz Sundstrom died October 2nd.  She was a wonderful woman and the love of my father's life.  She will be greatly missed by all of her family and friends.  Her obituary is to the right.  Betty and I attended her funeral last week.  All of her children and step-children attended, as did several of her grandchildren.  I bid her a fond farewell.  I will miss her.  </p>
<p>
Just a few notes about our summer:  <br/>
The weather was outstanding.  I completed tasks in restoring our property to good condition after nearly five years of absences.  I got the yard under control.  The lack of care had led to a jungle like condition.  Later I stained the house, garage, garden shed and the wooden fences.  By the end of the summer, I was finally ready to build a bathroom in the basement.  For many years Betty and Birgitta had requested that I put one in, but I had steadfastly refused.  But at last, I gave in. I started the work about Labor Day ( the first Monday in September) and I just completed the project yesterday.  I have posted a few pictures below.  </p>
<p>
I only did some light traveling this summer.  I took a one week trip to southern Indiana for family research.  I visited my brother Steve then and again at the end of July.  While in Appleton, I went the twenty miles to Oshkosh, where the annual EAA Air Venture air show is held.  I love all the airplanes and the air show.  In late August we attended the Minnesota State Fair.  It is a wonderful, old-fashion exhibition.  We love to see the craft exhibits and the animal exhibits, not to mention all the fantastic food.  I believe that nearly two million souls visited the fair this year. </p>
<p>
Betty and I will leave for Los Angeles next week.  A week after that we will be going to China.  We will roam all over China, Viet Nam, and Southeast Asia.  We may visit Australia and New Zealand also.  <br/>
<b>You can expect reports from those places in the months to come. </b> </p>

<p>Bill,</p>

<p>Sorry for the lost of your father's wife.  This has been a season that Sue and I have gone to too many funerals of parents who have passed away.  You and Betty enjoy your travels the next few months.  My brother has spent a lot of time in Viet Nam so you will enjoy that.  He has seem both sides of the country in the middle 60's and the past three years.  </p>

<p>Enjoy</p>

<p>Dana  </p>
