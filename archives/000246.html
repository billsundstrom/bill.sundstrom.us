Our second week in Ixtapa was not as busy as our first week.  Still we made it out twice for drinks and the sunset.    </p>

<p>
We decided to stay another week in Ixtapa.  </p>
<p>
One day we went to a fancy resort, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/LasBrisasIxtapa'>Las Brisas</a>, for drinks one evening with Lalo and his family.  Pina Coladas were the favorite at the table.  There was some mellow Mexican music coming from a live band.  The sunset was different, setting over a cloudbank out to sea.  </p>
<p>
One day we stopped at a mirador, lookout point, with a great view of Ixtapa.  There is the very green beach area where the only major structures in view are the high rise condos and hotels.  Then, inland a bit, are all the red roofs of the smaller condos where most of the city's population lives.  Just a really cool view!  </p>

<p>
On Sunday afternoon we visited the beach in Zihuatanejo.   We drank beer and had a light dinner.  It was great place to see the locals enjoying the beach.  And the sunset was spectacular that day.</p>
<p>
Nelly is a great cook.  She has shared some of her wonderful foods with us almost everyday.  We have only cooked for ourselves a couple of times.  We made our enchiladas one day.  They were appreciated, but nowhere near as good as Nelly's gastronomy.  </p>
<p>
Yesterday, we had a light meal in the evening with Julio and his wife.  It was a real pleasure to chat and drink beer.  I had made a bowl of ceviche the day before and I brought it with. It was devoured.  </p>
<p>
Today is Nelly’s birthday. Late this morning, we went for a birthday breakfast at wonderful boutique hotel in Zihuatanejo, called  <a href='http://www.lacasaquecanta.com'>La Casa Que Canta </a>.  While a bit pricey, the food was extremely good – especially Betty’s Chilaquiles. It was one of the most beautiful hotels that I have ever seen and views of the bay from the terrace were spectacular. </p>
<p>
Tonight we will all go out for pizza.  Birthdays appear to be two–day celebrations.    </p>
<p>
 Tomorrow we will go to Cuernavaca.  We have arranged a place to stay for the next two months at the same place we stayed in 2006. </p>

<p>How long  will you be in Cuernavaca? I haven't been there since the seventies, wonder if it's changed much.  I recommend you visit the Cuernavaca Language School, formerly CIDOC founded by Ivan Illich and my old Spanish professor at U of M. Just take a tour, it's like opening the gates to paradise. I remember at the bottom of the hill, amputee beggars worked the tourists -set out by a beggar's pimp. Once inside the gates, so different. Two links, first to the school, second on Ivan Ilych. I did not go to this school, mine was called Guanavac and it was on Morelos, the native name for Curenavaca - probably not there anymore or called something else. One of my favorite cities.<br />

<p>Yes us Latinos celebrate our birthdays for a week!<br />
Sounds like you are having a great time there. Getting warmer here in Mpls, if you call 15 degrees warm. Better than the 50 days of sub-zero temps- brrrr</p>
