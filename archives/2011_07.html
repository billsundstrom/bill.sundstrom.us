<p>
When I get older losing my hair,<br>
Many years from now,<br>
Will you still be sending me a valentine<br>
Birthday greetings bottle of wine?<br>
<br>
If I'd been out till quarter to three<br>
Would you lock the door,<br>

Will you still need me, will you still feed me,<br>
When I'm sixty-four?<br>
<br>
oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oooo<br>
You'll be older too, (ah ah ah ah ah)<br>
And if you say the word,<br>
I could stay with you.<br>
<br>
I could be handy mending a fuse<br>
When your lights have gone.<br>

You can knit a sweater by the fireside<br>
Sunday mornings go for a ride.<br>
<br>
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,<br>
Who could ask for more?<br>
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,<br>
When I'm sixty-four?<br>
<br>
Every summer we can rent a cottage<br>
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear<br>

We shall scrimp and save<br>
Grandchildren on your knee<br>
Vera, Chuck, and Dave<br>
<br>
Send me a postcard, drop me a line,<br>
Stating point of view.<br>
Indicate precisely what you mean to say<br>
Yours sincerely, Wasting Away.<br>
<br>
Give me your answer, fill in a form<br>

Mine for evermore<br>
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,<br>
When I'm sixty-four?<br>
<br>
Whoo!

For many years, I threw a big party for my birthday.  Then I turned 60 years old.  That was the last time I had a big birthday party.  I planned to to have one this year.  However, my sister Gay Lynn is turning 60 and she is planning a huge party in two weeks.  So, I thought it would be better to let all the lime light shine on her.</p>
<p><b>
Still, I am <u>64</u>  years old today.</b></p>
<p>
The summer that I turned 20 years old, the Beatles release their <i><b>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</b></i> album. Roughly two years later, I really was getting into the Beatles.  It might have even been at one of my birthday parties, that I was listening in the purple haze to "When I'm Sixty-Four" and laughing.  I said to my friends "Will we ever be 64?"  I think it was Greg Speltz or John Ganapes that assured me that, yes, we would be 64. But would we still be friends, sharing wine and spending time together.</p>
<p>
I thought some about growing old over the years.  I always knew that we might all get together again when I turned 64, because I would throw a party.  Thankfully, many of my friends from 40 years ago are still my friends.  And, of course, I have many new friends.  </p>
<p>
I will be at Gay Lynn's 60th birthday party on July 16th.  I hope to see a lot of my old friends there. She will welcome all of you. </p>
<p>
The lyrics to that old Beatles song haunt me a bit.  But the answers the questions posed in the song are clear.   You will be sending me a valentine, sending birthday greetings and sharing a bottle of wine. </p>
