<h3 class="title">Looking Back at 2006</h3>

<p>
Today marks the close of another year.  </p>
<p>
2006 began with a drive across the northern prairie.  Deep snow banks, some as high as five feet, lined the freeway as we headed west.  We arrived in Portland three days later to attend the wedding of my nephew, Shelby, and Kate.  We headed south visiting friends and family in California and Arizona, not to mention a couple of days in Las Vegas.  </p>

<b> New Year's Eve <br/>
Motoring in Hanoi </b><br/>
<img alt='IMG_1959.jpg'  src='http://bill.sundstrom.us/archives/IMG_1959.jpg'  /> </p> </div>
<p>
Then we spent four wonderful months exploring Mexico together from northern Sonora to the south coast of Oaxaca.   We lived for a month in Cuernavaca.   The sun and the warmth did us well.  In April on the way back to our northern summer abode, we stopped to visit my parents in Mississippi.  It was that last time we were to see LaVera, she died in October.   </p>
<p>
The summer was beautiful.  I needed the great weather to have the time outside to restore the garden to its previous glory.  After five years of neglect, it was a necessary task.  As the summer wound down, I built a bathroom in the basement.  </p>
<p>
In October it was time to head for warmer climates again.  We spent a week with our son, Dain, in Santa Monica.  Then it was on to China.  We spent two months exploring a very large country and only seeing a very small part of it.  The charm and the friendliness of the Chinese people are likely to draw us back again.    </p>
<p>
We end 2006 much like we started it, traveling and enjoying our retirement.  We are in Hanoi. Being away from our family at Christmas can be hard.  The gift giving is difficult, but not impossible.  Giving friends and family hearty seasons greetings and hugs is impossible.  Thank goodness for the internet that gives a modicum of contact.  I called Carol and Doug on Christmas Eve.  Every year they host a wonderful family party.  I was able to call and wish them all a Merry Christmas. <br/>
<b>Unfortunately, a few days later the internet in SE Asia came crashing down, when an earthquake destroyed the many of the main cables off Taiwan that link this part of the world to North America</b>.  We have email, but not much more. </p>
<p>
We are looking forward to a happy new year.  We will continue to travel in Southeast Asia.  We may even reach the shores of Australia.  Keep reading this BLOG and you can read our stories and see our photographs.  </p>
<p align='center'>
We wish you<br/>
<b><u> All the Happiness in the NEW YEAR</u>!</b> </p>
