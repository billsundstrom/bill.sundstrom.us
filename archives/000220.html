<h3 class="title">An Open Letter to Randy</h3>

<p>
 My cousin Randy is a guy that has had a hard life.  Things have seldomly gone his way until recent years, when things turned around.  He got a good job driving trucks from coast to coast.  Sometimes I have trouble understanding him.  I often feel that the conservative talk radio broadcasters have affected his thinking.  Of course, these broadcasters have affected the thinking of most Americans turning them against their own best interests.  I would really like to see Randy <b>begin</b> to change his mind set by  answering two <b>excellent</b> questions he posed in a recent facebook post.<br/>
To that end I offer him this open letter.</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Dear Randy, </p>
<p> Recently I posted on facebook <a href='http://www.facebook.com/#!/bill.sundstrom/posts/10150096318132771'>the following</a>: <br/>
"Looks like the people of Wisconsin need an immediate change of regime. Can the governor of Wisconsin be recalled by the people?"
There were 39 comments that friends and relatives added to this post; more than I had to any previous post.  The discussion was good and interesting.  </p>
<p>
You kindly added a couple of comments.  The most meaningful were two important questions for which I thank you.  What you wrote follows
"So public employes who work for the pubic need protection from the people who they serve? So, those who are non public employed are having a hard time creating revenue they need to sacrifice more so that the government employes can continue on with his life unchanged?"    </p>
<p>
I hope to answer your questions.  But before doing that I think it is important to understand what Governor Scott Walker is really trying to do and some speculation on his motivations. </p>
<p>
Gov. Walker is out to destroy public employee unions and weaken the the entire trade union movement.  Governor Walker has a <a href='http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-10646-issue-of-the-week-scott-walkerrss-courthouse-security-privatization-epic-fail.html' target="_blank" >history</a> of attacking public trade unions.  When he was the Executive of  Milwaukee County, he tried to replace unionized security guards at the county courthouse and replace them with contractors, which he promised would save the county money.  The county board refused to replace them. But Walker took executive action on his own.  The county was sued and lost, costing the people of Milwaukee half-a-million dollars.  <b>All</b> the Wisconsin public unions have said that they would accept concessions to wages and benefits.  Gov. Walker was notified of this concession and he was asked if he would drop the legislation.  His answer was <b>"NO!"</b> His history is that of a union buster. Now that he refuses to negotiate with these unions it is clear that his agenda is not to protect Wisconsinites, rather it is to destroy public and private unions in Wisconsin and the rest of the US. </p>
<p>
American workers fought long and hard for the right to have unions.  They made this a great country for the common man.  What Walker is really trying to do is make the US like every other poor country where his super rich, blood sucking friends make billions on the backs of a  beaten-down and impoverished people.  <u>Randy is that really what you want for America</u>?  I doubt it.  It is undemocratic to take away rights of workers, it is anti-American.  I certainly do not want that.  I hope that you and I can agree on stopping these blood suckers from ruining our way of life. </p>
<p><b>
Randy, ask yourself why Gov. Walker wants to bust these unions,</b> after all the state, county and municipal workers do not work for profit making organizations.  He cannot be just acting to save the people of Wisconsin a few dollars.   There are, in fact, several reasons.  The most important are <b> MONEY and POWER,</b>  money to influence elections and public opinion and the power to run the state with no checks on his power. Recently, corporations were granted the ability to give anonymously billions of dollars to candidates, most often but not exclusively to Republicans. Scott Walker and his party have greatly benefitted from this change.  Unfortunately for Walker, trade unions give money to candidates too, primarily Democrats.  Of course, they do not come anywhere close to the resources of large corporations, but their money means a lot and it can affect elections.  If unions are weakened or eliminated, then there will be less money for Democrats. Further, Gov. Walker and all Republicans would find it easy to take POWER in the future. To be clear, Democrats are not are saviors, but they will not try to destroy our way of life like the Republicans are only too glad to do, as witnessed in Wisconsin. </p>
<p><b>
Clearly, Walker wants to destroy the American way of life and ensure that his blood sucking friends will be able live higher and better for years to come, while we middle-class Americans are pushed into poverty.</b>  That is not what I want and I am sure that you do not want that either. After all, our personal well-being, our families' well-being, and the well-being of our communities are at stake.  We have to be brave and stand-up to these attacks.  </p>

<p align='center'><b> Comparison of Wisconsin<br/>Public and Private Sector Annual Wages   </b></p>
<img alt="Wisc-PW-wages.jpg" src="http://bill.sundstrom.us/archives/Wisc-PW-wages.jpg" width="454" height="290" border="0" />
</div>
<p>
Now, lets take a look at the excuses Walker presented to justify his demand to end public unions.  He says that there is a huge state deficit.  First one should ask, is that even true?  The answer depends on your definition of huge, because the deficit is completely manageable and is not worse than the last deficit.  So, Walker's excuse is a <b>big fat lie.</b>  Second, he states that the unions have made and will continue to make unreasonable demands. Yet Wisconsin unions have already agreed to reduced wages and benefits.  So, this too is a <b>big fat lie.</b>  But it does not matter because he and his friends have already convinced thousands of others that unions are bad, evil groups out to enrich themselves and bankrupt America.  I worked for 30 years for the City of Minneapolis and I always earned significantly less than people doing the same thing in the private sector.  The chart on the right show how much less Wisconsin state employees make when compared to the private sector.  The numbers are simply shocking.  Clearly, public employees are motivated to work for something other than money.  My own experience tells me that public employees mostly work out of a desire to serve the public good. Yes, my pension is a good one. During my last ten years working for the city, the only thing that kept me working there was the promise of a half-way decent pension.  The promise of the pension and my desire to serve kept me from going to the private sector where I knew I could earn twice a much money.  It was the promise of a future benefit that kept me there.  I considered the promise of the pension as part of my compensation.  And I contributed much more to my pension fund than what you pay for social security.   Gov. Walker wants to steal that from the workers of Wisconsin, because he says that it is too much.  I will come back to this theft below.  It is <b>immoral</b> to promise to pay someone for something they have done and they NOT pay them.  You are moral man, so I doubt that you would want to do that - but Gov. Walker does.  He is thief, a thief of our livelihood, our dreams and the American way of life.  <br/>
I say, <b><u>DAMN</u> Governor Walker - a liar and a thief.</b></p>
<p>
Now, allow me to answer your first question. Historically, governments have acted in horrid ways.  They have attacked and murdered people for demanding for basic human rights. In the last 150 years governments in USA have acted time and time again to oppress working people and people of color. Organizing public unions is not needed to protect workers from the people, but from oppressive government.  The most important right for workers is the right to organize themselves and collectively bargain  for better wages and working conditions.  The people of the United States battled government and corporations from the late 1800's to the mid 1900's for the right to bargain collectively. In fact, the US has the bloodiest labor history in the world, because the US had the most powerful corporate owners in the world.  Scott Walker is a modern-day shill for this same class of tyrants.  They want to turn the clock back to the bad old days when workers had NO control over their lives. <br/>
<b>What Wisconsin workers will never concede is their right to collectively bargain.</b><br/>   
Randy, who will you stand with?  Your working friends and neighbor or the the rich, blood sucking patrons of Gov. Scott Walker? </p>
<p>
I believe that I have already answered your second question about the willingness of the Wisconsin public employees to make concessions in these difficult times. But Walker just will not take YES for an answer. </p>
<p>
Finally, I want to add a small ironic aside.  How is it that so many pension plans are underfunded today?  Not ALL of them are in trouble but many are.  The primary reason was the financial collapse in 2008.  Pension funds hired respectable Wall Street investment firms.  In a diabolic  scheme, these firms invested retirement money in risky hedge funds.  When the bottom fell out, the retirement funds were left holding the bag.  The government, through TARP, bailed out the banks but did nothing for the retirement funds.  They stole billions from US workers in the greatest scam of all times.  Worse yet them seem to have gotten away with it, as none have been jailed, just more government corruption and collusion with the super rich.  The IRONY is that now these same blood suckers want to use the excuse of depleted pension funds to attack and destroy their last contingent of their mortal enemy, American trade unions. </p>
<p>
Randy, your a workingman as your father was and your children will be.  Trade unions have made your life much better.  They fought for and won the 40-hour week, health care and workplace safety. If allowed to, unions will continue to serve and protect all American workers.<br/>  
<b>The time has come to stop disparaging the very people that brought you and your family a better life, <br/>
because it is time to praise and protect them.</b> That is the <b>RIGHT</b> and <b>MORAL</b> thing to do.</p>
<p>
The next time we find ourselves in the same city, I hope that we can sit down and talk about all these things.  </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your loving cousin,  </p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>In Finland the problem is not created by inflated salaries, but by the size of the public sector. Currently there are 800 000 employees while the whole size of the work force is 2 370 000 people (plus 9.5 % are unemployed and tens of thousands are hidden from the statistics to various  artificial trainings).</p>

<p>The ratio between the public and the private sector is 1/3 meaning that 2/3's of the workers have to pay for for the 1/3 plus all the unemployed. Some people in Finland consider this unfair especially now, when they have used the future pension money to keep up the public sector afloat, and at the same time the amount of employees in the private sector employees is decreasing rapidly.</p>

<p>Now that Nokia is moving to the US, there will be tens of thousands of new unemployed people and not too many left to pay the world's highest taxes for maintaining the world's most useless and bloated public sector.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the public sector itself, and the politicians, have no interest in fixing the problem they have caused.</p>

<p>Hope it eases your pain to hear that you and the US are not alone.</p>
