Our 2007 has been good.  It started in Hanoi after six weeks in China.  We spent another four months in Asia, exploring Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Malaysia and Singapore.  In the summer I visited Wisconsin.  We spent three months in the fall exploring Saskatchewan, Alberta British Columbia, Oregon, California, Arizona, Mississippi and North Carolina.  </p>

In late November our first granddaughter, Johanna, entered this world.  She is a great joy to us.  We have had the pleasure of holding her, singing to her, dancing with her, talking to her, feeding her and loving her. </p>
<p>
We had a great Christmas. <br/>
On Christmas Eve we visited the home of Carol and Doug Olausen.  Carol is one of our oldest friends and years later she joined the family when she married Doug, who is the brother-in-law of my brother Brian.  All the Olausens were there as was my brother and my sister, Gay Lynn and her husband, Randy, and other friends and family.
On Christmas Day we had a wonderful ham dinner with our children and their partners and of course with Johanna.  We had many visitors: My niece, Aricka and her children, my brother Brian and his wife Judy, Tom and Heidi Schmidt dropped by with their youngest, Ada – a seven month old baby.  So we had three babies in the house: Eva, Ada and Johanna.  It was a wonderful day</p>

</div>
<p>
On Thursday, Brian and I visited our aunt Elinor and out on the farm my uncle Vernon.  We had a wonderful visit with each of them.    </p>
<p>
Saturday, we visited my brother Steve and his wife Ellen in Wisconsin.  In the evening we attended a reception for James Cassady, and his wife Deepika Kakani.  They married 26 October 2007 in Wellington, New Zealand.  Deepi is a doctor and lives in Minnesota. James does contract management for a large pharmaceutical company.  His father, John, is Betty’s brother.  It was fun and we got to see some folks that we had not seen in years.  </p>
<p>
Six weeks in the snow and freezing weather has us thinking about warmer climes. We have heard that the snow fall is the greatest in many, many years.  On Christmas day more than six inches fell and there is more than twelve inches (30 cm) on the ground right now. Only the warmth of our family could keeps us going. </p>
<p>
In 2008, we will head first to the Southeast part of the USA.  We will first visit Charlotte, Charleston and Savannah, before dropping in on my sister Dawn in Greensboro <br/>
If all goes well, then we will return to South America.  We will visit friends in Chile first.  We will travel from Santiago to Chiloé.  Then we will cross the Andes to Argentina once more.  We will travel to the far South, then back to our friends in Buenos Aires. <br/>
Our plans after that are hazier.  As the haze lifts we will let you know what will come next.  <br clear='all'/> </p>
