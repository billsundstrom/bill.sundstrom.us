Evalyn Charlotte Busch<br />
28 August 1928 to 5 June 2012 </p>
<p>
Evalyn C. Busch passed away Tuesday, June 5th at Victor Valley Community Hospital, Victorville, CA. She was born August 28, 1928, in St. Peter, MN, to Charles and Evalyn Brinker.  While attending Minnesota Bible College, she met her husband to be, Loren Eugene Busch.   Evalyn enjoyed music, singing, cooking, baking and spending time with her family and friends.  Evalyn worked for the Victor Valley School District from 1968 to 1990 in the school cafeteria.  This way she was always home with her children.  She was a member of the Victor Valley Christian Church since 1970, singing in the choir and was a song leader during church services for many years.  <br/>
Evalyn is survived by her three sons Steve, Randall and Charles (Sheryll) Busch; two daughters Judy Waltman and Mary Cox; seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews.  She was preceded in death by her loving husband, Loren, who has now greeted her in Heaven, both of her parents; two brothers, Charles and Glenn Brinker; and two sisters, Mary Baggenstoss and June Benton.  </p>

My aunt Tiny died on the 5th of June.  She was the last surviving sibling of my mother.  Tiny had not been in good health for some time.  She had a serious stroke last year, and her death was not unexpected.  I had seen her this past winter while Betty and I were living in California.  I am so glad that we were able to visit.  Her bright, brown eyes brought a tear to my eye as I saw my own mother in her.  I will miss her so much.   </p>

10 May 1952 to 26 June 2012</p>
<p>
Steven L. Busch, 60, passed away suddenly from natural causes the evening of 26 June 2012 in Victorville. Steve was born 10 May 1952 in Riverside to the late Loren Eugene and Evelyn Charlotte (Brinker) Busch. His family moved to the Victorville in the 1967.  Steve graduated from Victor Valley High School in 1970.   The next year he attended broadcasting school in Hollywood. He worked for Builders Emporium and H & E Home Builders before becoming a fireman and paramedic for the City of Hesperia. Steve worked more than twenty years as an emergency medical technician before retiring in 2002.  Steve worked with and for several community organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America, the California Fire Exploring Association and the development of the local Explorer Fire Department Academey.  He received recognition and awards for his service, including the <i>William H. Spurgeon</i> award for his 17 years of service to scouting programs. Steve loved to travel and share his stories.  Steven was a kind and generous man, and was always there to help his friends and family. <br/>
Steve is survived by two sisters, Judy Waltman and Mary Cox, both of Vista; and two brothers Randy of Victorville and Chuck of Hesperia; nephews Ryan (Dana) Waltman, Evan, Tyler, Chad and Troy Busch; nieces Dana (Steve) Trimmins and Kristen Cox.

<p>
Tiny's primary caregiver was her son, Steven.  Steven was a rock, when came to caring for his mom.  He made sure that she had everything that she needed to ease her pain and care for her in every way.   Steven had plans to explore the world more extensively after the passing of his mom.  He was planning to visit us and many of his relatives in Minnesota and Wisconsin this week.  In fact he had called my sister in Minneapolis and his nephew in Kenosha on June 26th.  He also called me, but I was not home, but he talked to Betty for quite a while.    </p>
<p>
Steven died of a massive heart attach on the evening of June 26th, just three weeks after his mother passed.  His passing was not expected and it came as a shock to everyone in the family.  Steven was one of the kindest and most generous people that I have ever known.  </p>
<p>
The memorial service was this past weekend.  My sister, Gay Lynn, and brother, Brian, and I traveled to Victorville for the memorial service this past weekend.  For the service Tiny's daughter, Mary Waltman, put together two wonderful slide shows with photos from the lives of Tiny and Steven.  Those slide shows brought laughter, joy and tears to our eyes. You will find them elsewhere on this page.  </p>
