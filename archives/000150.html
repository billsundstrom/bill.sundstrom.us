We had a great Thanksgiving holiday this year.  Betty and Birgitta spent several days planning and preparing for the great feast.  And what a feast it was.  The center piece was a beautiful free-range turkey stuffed with Betty’s wonderful sage dressing.  The gravy and mashed potatoes were so tasty.  We had yams and a medley of winter roots.  The deserts were traditional pumpkin pie and a cherry pie.  There were fresh baked rolls on every plate.</p>

<b> Children with Their Mother: Athena, Ebin, Ava and Aricka </b><br/>

<p>
We had a houseful of people.  Dain and Marleta came from Santa Monica.  My niece, Aricka, came with her three children: Athena, Ebin and Eva.  Athena is 21 years old; Ebin is 10; and Ava was born in July.  Birgitta and Seth were here, too.  Birgitta was good to go until dinner, but she tired quickly after eating.  Her baby was overdue. </p>
<p>
We had a great evening.  We talked on and on.  It was really nice to have Aricka over.  It was the first time we had all her children over together.  I had never really talked to Athena before.  It was nice to get to know her.  She is a premed student at the U in Duluth and will graduate this next year.  Ebin liked being over, but he didn’t like chatting it up.  He tried playing the piano.  Then he found a computer game that interested him.  Then he was gone for the evening.  Little Eva was loved by everyone.  I discovered that Marleta loves to hold and rock babies.  We opened several great bottles of red wine throughout the evening.      </p>
<p>
Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday.  Betty made the day very special this year.  Because of her effort we had a wonderful time and truly enjoyed the day.  <br clear='all'/>  </p>
