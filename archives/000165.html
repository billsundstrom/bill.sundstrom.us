<h3 class="title">Change in America </h3>

<h1 align='center'><u>
Congratulations Barack Obama</u></h1>
<p>
America made a small turn to the left yesterday with its election of Barack Obama.  Neither Betty nor I are confident that he will move the ship of state very far to the left.  However, we are sure that the next four years will be better for Americans and the rest of the world.  For this we are so thankful.  We thank all who voted for Barack.  </p>
<p>
The biggest part of the Democratic agenda this next year will be to get the economy back on track.  We are afraid that the government will just continue to bail out the rich.  McCain accused Barack of being a socialist, despite that he is not even close to having a social democratic perspective.  That is why we expect conditions to get better but not to be a great victory for the American worker.  The most we can hope for will be the development of some form of socialized medicine on the line of what exists in Canada or Europe.  The reality is that the insurance companies and privately owned health industry will likely end up the beneficiary of any change – just as the drug companies did with the Medicare drug benefit for the elderly.  </p>
<p>
Yes, I am a bit cynical.  Sixty years of American life have taught me that the rich have a strangle hold on minds and psyche of the American people. I will hope for a reasonable move to the left, but I do not expect much.  Unless some deep systematic changes come in the next four years, there is a good chance that the changes will not stick. Why? You might ask.  The answer is simple: 45% of the American people voted for John McCain, a man dedicated to deregulation of financial institutions and a war-hawk and some (including me) would say a war criminal for dropping bombs on civilians in the Vietnam War.  No mater how you cut it, the American people have bought the lies and distortions of the right.  Despite the richness of this land, and strength and industriousness of its people, they will continue to suffer, continue to experience falling wages and a miserable health system until they wake up to the realities of our system and vote in huge numbers for leftist candidates – who will finally change the system permanently.</p>
<h2 align='center'><u>
Congratulations Barack Obama,</u><br/>
Please make this a better country!</h2>

<p>Dear Bill (and the lovely Betty):</p>

<p>I´m pretty much in complete agreement with you and your assessment of Obama´s win as our next President. I, too, hope for at least a modest change for the better. However, back in 1998-99 when I had the second chance in my life to move out of the USA and see how well EU countries were doing it finally dawned on my dull little mind that the change I souight would not happen for me or people like me for many more decades. I don´t have many more decades. Therefore, I bailed the USA for life and work in Spain, and now I also spend a good portion of the year in Buenos Aires and British Columbia. </p>

<p>You see, I doubt the ´Mericuhn psyche is ready to let me sit at the big persons table any time soon as a married, gay male. However, Spain and most EU countries have woken up and now recognize my right and privilege to be married (with all the good and bad that status carries). All of Canada is on board (despite Stephen Harper, Canada´s version of Bush Jr.) and it´s rather pleasant to know that I do no longer have to worry about the potential legal challenge of transfer of property when either I or my spouse kick the bucket. I´ve a ton of mormon relatives who would definitely go to the mat, laying claim to my trust and estate in the USA. But as a bone fide resident of Spain, I no longer need to worry about such bottom feeders.</p>

<p>I also view the "patriot" known as McCain as a war criminal. I never thought the USA would ever get into another senseless war such as Viet Nam. I still view that "conflict" as a monstrous tragedy in which there were no war heros, only war victims. McCain was and still is a victim of that war. Concidentally, when you think about it he´s never had to pay for his own health insurance at any time in his entire life. His father was career military as was his grandfather. As a leader of the USA, I´m afraid he would have been completely out of touch with what the rest of us taxpayers have to deal with. Rich friends, indeed. </p>

<p>Back in 1967 when "faggots" were automatically disenfranchised from the "official 'Mericuhn way of life" and they didn't want us to serve in the military (my, how times have changed in 50 years,  no?) I became a VISTA volunteer and worked in the Four Corners area of the USA for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Volunteers in Service To America was more interested in if I could type rather with whom I slept with. And working for the BIA was a major eye-opener. After 2.5 years of working as basically a secretary, taking orders from retired military double-dipping as do-nothing civil employees I had satisfied my personal debt to serve 'Mericuh -- at least that was what the government claimed at the time. Still, I received no benefits similar to those bestowed upon men and women who served in the military. That should have been enough of a first wake-up call to realize maybe I would flourish in some other country. But I´m dull and somwhat trusting. </p>

<p>Still, I am pleased with the current swing to the Democrats and the possibility that a little bit of social correction may happen in the next 4 years. I´ll never return to the USA for more than 4 or 5 weeks a year -- if that -- just to ensure my business interests are OK and my taxes are paid. In fact, I´d be happy to pay more taxes if the money was actually used to rebuild the country´s infrastructure, social programs, and help the poor and otherwise disenfranchised. </p>

<p>Well, enough ranting. Thanks for allowing me the space and opportunity to chime in about the USA. Also, please excuse my poor spelling. Almost 20 years of living in Spanish-speaking countries has pretty much ruined my ability to remember how to spell correctly in English. </p>

<p>Best wishes to you both.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of this election is the unexpected number of people actually supporting our new president, whether they voted for him or not. Yesterday and today I saw many interviews with regular folks who voted for MCain but are embracing Obama, because they believe he will bring change. But even before that, we had the conservative columnists and pundits who endorsed Obama -- George Will, Christopher Buckley, David Brooks, etc.  Then former military leaders like Colin Powell, next  pop stars and television hosts -- Elizabeth Hasselbeck, who although she voted for McCain, acknowledges that Obama's campain was in itself a character in play when it came to getting out the vote and energizing the electorate; she  also said that Obama was an extraordinary leader who would bring change. </p>

<p><br />
Regarding left leaning politicians -- just because they lean left doesn't mean they are inheritently smart decision makers, tireless workers, or innoculated against corruption, or in any way prepared to help the American people lead better  lives.  All politicians promise a lot of things, and depending on what people actually let them get away with, can do more harm then good at times.</p>

<p>I say, rise ye mighty people.  We have a chance at a better future with this one.</p>

<p>Dear Bill and Betty,</p>

<p>I am glad that the majority of the US voted for a change. That said I am also agree that Obama might not be the best you have, but with the best marketing. Obama did not prove to me that he will be good for the US, but he is the less evil. Hillary might have been a better choice. Nevertheless, as a European I am glad that the nightmare is over.</p>

<p>Let him first clean up your country after 8 years of mismanagement and then becoming friends with all the countries that Bush pissed of.</p>

<p>Big hug from Argentina,<br />

<p>After I Heard!<br />
What was it? It was more than shared fear, more than giving thanks for what we had while realizing that it might soon be stolen away. I didn't understand it then, in that time of frenzy, in that euphoria of frantic preparations. Now looking back, it is an easy thing to recognize. <br />
It was Hope!<br />
To any intelligent being, there is no emotion more important than hope. Individually or collectively, we must hope that the future will be better than the past, that our offspring, and theirs after them, will be a bit closer to an ideal society, whatever our perception of that might be. Certainly each of us has our own vision of what it looks like. But the hope itself is not so different. It is at those times when we feel we are contributing to that ultimate end, as in this election - that we feel true elation. Hope is the key. The future will be better than the past, or the present. Without this belief, there is only self-indulgent, ultimately empty striving of the present or simple despair.<br />
We have found a cause; let us hope together.</p>

<p>One in the crowd,</p>

<p>Jefferson Kendall</p>

<p>Well said, Bill! I have agreed with and enjoyed hearing your take on politics since before your SDS days 35yrs ago.<br />
My hopes and thoughts are that Obama can truly be an influence for positive change in America. He is certainly better than the alternative!</p>
