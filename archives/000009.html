Thursday, 19 February:<br/>
As I was saying in my last entry, I was at the beach, at Playas Novillero.  The beach is wonderful, beautiful soft sand.  There are very few people in living on the beach and almost no tourists.  The room I took was ok.  I could have had one that opened to the beach, sort of anyway, but I took another. When I got up this morning, I was disappointed to find no hot water.  I decided to move on, but if all the beaches in Nayarit are like this, it would be a good place to spend some time if you could find the same with a little bit more life.  After breakfast I was on my way to Guadalajara.  The dry fields dominated the countryside, but I saw thousands of acres in agave as I approached Guadalajara.  It was no surprise when I later discovered the town I was passing through was called Tequila.<br/>
I arrived in the late afternoon.  It seemed that it took forever to find a place to stay.  I did get a chance to see a bit of the city. Finally I settled. I went out to update this blog, and eat.</p>

Friday:<br/>
I decide to leave the hotel, too noisy.  I went to the information bureau.  It is in a wonderful downtown area.  The city has some fantastic public areas, with fountains and sculptures. As I drove about the city, I did not see an area that I wanted to stay in.  The city and its suburbs has a population of more that three million and perhaps more than five million.  It is dry, dusty, and hazy; pollution?  I decided to drive around a bit.  It was not a city I wanted to stay in.  I am sure there are nice neighborhoods, but the ambiance was not what I expected.  I decided to head south for Lake Chapala.  The lake is gigantic, but the lake has been loosing water for years.  The hyacinths have inundated the lake, not a pretty picture.  Heavily developed on the north side of the lake, and almost deserted on the south side. The fields started to turn green as I headed down highway 15.  I passed through dozens of small towns.  And finally I put down in Zacapu.  I went into the center of down after checking in.  It is a typical small town, with a nice plaza and public spaces.  I stopped for dinner.  It was excellent.  I hiked back to the hotel and put in for the night.</p>

Saturday, February 21, 2004:<br/>
I was only 84 km from Morelia, but I am sure it took more than two hours to drive there.  It was the typical narrow two lane road with far too much traffic on it. Along the way I had some beautiful views of Lake Patzcuaro.  If I get a chance I will drive back here and check out the area around the lake.  The major delay as I approached Morelia was a public works project that was putting in new sewers and possibly rebuilding the road.
As I drove into the el centro, I knew this was a city that I would have to stay in.  The colonial buildings have been carefully protected.  The plazas and cathedrals were beautiful. I check with the tourist bureau.  They had lists of hotels but really no information on the quality, cost, or additional amenities for each.  I got some info on goings on in the city too.  Then I went about the arduous task of looking for a place to stay.  What made it so difficult was the irregular system of one-way streets.  Finally, I found one that looked nice, with lots of character and big windows, TV and hot water.  I studied a bit of Spanish and got ready for the evening.  After a meal with too much beef, I walked through the central plaza.  I had heard about a place with music and beer nearby, and I went there.  It was not really what I wanted to see being more of a show, than a cantina.  The manager was nice enough to direct me to Porfiriana, where one could find live salsa music and dancing in one room, a balladeer in another and pool tables in yet another.  I wish that I had continued practicing the salsa dances that I had learning in Guatemala. It was really a great spot for an evening of fun. I watched people dancing and having a good time and drank beers until a little after midnight.<br/>  
I walked back to my hotel.  When I arrive I could here live salsa music play.  "Where is that coming from?" I asked.  There was a cantina in the basement.  I thought, what the heck, I would check this one out too.  I thought the place a bit strange.  The music was good,  and I thought the place was a just a more working class version of Porfiriana.  The women were mostly big(!) and dressed provocatively, showing a lot of cleavage. I bought a beer for 20 pesos.  Before long one of the women in the bar saddled up next to me and before long asked me to buy here a beer.  "Sure," I said.  The waiter asked me for 30 pesos.  "No way," I said, "they cost 20 pesos!"  For the women it costs 30 pesos.  I told him and her to forget it.  I asked the bartender if all the women in the bar work for the bar, and indeed they did.  I put my half finished bottle on the counter and walked out.  But I did not entire escape the sounds of the bar.  The music and the noise in the street kept me up literally all night. The bar music stopped about 3 or 4 am.  But the noise of cars and motorcycles drove me crazy.  Why was there so much traffic?  I peeked out the second story window.  Many of the bar ladies were now on the corner below, selling themselves. Finally about 6:30 it quieted down with the earplugs from my Rio player that I put in my ears.  I got about less than three hours sleep.  </p>

Sunday, February 22, 2004:<br/>
First thing I did after showering, was arrange for a different room.  Then I ate, rested and took off to see much of the town and  take some photos (see extended enty). When I got back I rested and started writing.  I guess I am feeling better, even on three hours of sleep.   </p>
