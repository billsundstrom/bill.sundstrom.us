<p>
Evalyn C. Busch passed away Tuesday, June 5th at Victor Valley Community Hospital, Victorville, CA. She was born August 28, 1928, in St. Peter, MN, to Charles and Evalyn Brinker.  While attending Minnesota Bible College, she met her husband to be, Loren Eugene Busch.   Evalyn enjoyed music, singing, cooking, baking and spending time with her family and friends.  Evalyn worked for the Victor Valley School District from 1968 to 1990 in the school cafeteria.  This way she was always home with her children.  She was a member of the Victor Valley Christian Church since 1970, singing in the choir and was a song leader during church services for many years.  <br/>
Evalyn is survived by her three sons Steve, Randall and Charles (Sheryll) Busch; two daughters Judy Waltman and Mary Cox; seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews.

My aunt Tiny died on the 5th of June.  She was the last surviving sibling of my mother.  Tiny had not been in good health for some time.  She had a serious stroke last year, and her death was not unexpected.  I had seen her this past winter while Betty and I were living in California.  I am so glad that we were able to visit.  Her bright, brown eyes brought a tear to my eye as I saw my own mother in her.  I will miss her so much.   </p>

Tiny's primary caregiver was her son, Steven.  Steven was a rock, when came to caring for his mom.  He made sure that she had everything that she needed to ease her pain and care for her in every way.   Steven had plans to explore the world more extensively after the passing of his mom.  He was planning to visit us and many of his relatives in Minnesota and Wisconsin this week.  In fact he had called my sister in Minneapolis and his nephew in Kenosha on June 26th.  He also called me, but I was not home, but he talked to Betty for quite a while.    </p>
<p>
Steven died of a massive heart attach on the evening of June 26th, just three weeks after his mother passed.  His passing was not expected and it came as a shock to everyone in the family.  Steven was one of the kindest and most generous people that I have ever known.  </p>
<p>
The memorial service was this past weekend.  My sister, Gay Lynn, and brother, Brian, and I traveled to Victorville for the memorial service this past weekend.  For the service Tiny's daughter, Mary Waltman, put together two wonderful slide shows with photos from the lives of Tiny and Steven.  Those slide shows brought laughter, joy and tears to our eyes. You will find them elsewhere on this page.  </p>
